Citing reliability in your work
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The following reference is using APA (6th edition):

**Reid, M. (2020). Reliability – a Python library for reliability engineering (Version 0.4.8) [Python].**

If you would like to use another referencing style, the details you may need are:

- **Author:** Matthew Reid
- **Year published:** 2020
- **Title:** Reliability – a Python library for reliability engineering
- **Version:** 0.4.8
- **Platform:** Python
- **Available from:** https://pypi.org/project/reliability/

Note that the version number is constantly changing so please check `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/reliability/>`_ for the current version.

If you have used ``reliability`` in any published academic work, I would love to hear about it (m.reid854@gmail.com). Depending on the usage, I may provide a link to your work below.

**Links to articles and papers that have used the Python reliability library:**

- `Probabilistic characterization of random variables - Phase II <https://medium.com/@javier8amoreno/caracterizaci%C3%B3n-probabilista-de-variables-aleatorias-fase-ii-215793df2cc>`_ - by Javier Alfonso Ochoa Moreno. Note that this article is in Spanish.
