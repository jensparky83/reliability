Fitting all available distributions to data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To fit all of the `distributions available <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20a%20specific%20distribution%20to%20data.html>`_ in ``reliability``, is a similar process to fitting a specific distribution. The user needs to specify the failures and any right censored data. The Beta distribution will only be fitted if you specify data that is in the range {0,1}. The selection of what can be fitted is all done automatically based on the data provided.

Inputs:

-   failures - an array or list of the failure times.
-   right_censored - an array or list of the right failure times.
-   sort_by - goodness of fit test to sort results by. Must be either 'BIC' or 'AIC'. Default is BIC.
-   show_histogram_plot - True/False. Defaults to True. Will show the PDF and CDF of the fitted distributions along with a histogram of the failure data.
-   show_PP_plot - True/False. Defaults to True. Provides a comparison of parametric vs non-parametric fit using a `semiparametric Probability-Probability (PP) plot <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Probability-Probability%20plots.html#semiparametric-probability-probability-plot>`_ for each fitted distribution.
-   show_probability_plot - True/False. Defaults to True. Provides a `probability plot <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Probability%20plots.html>`_ of each of the fitted distributions.
-   print_results - True/False. Defaults to True. Will show the results of the fitted parameters and the goodness of fit tests in a dataframe.

Outputs:

-   results - a dataframe of the fitted distributions and their parameters, along with the AICc and BIC goodness of fit statistics. This is sorted automatically to provide the best fit first. Use the sort_by='BIC' to change the sort between AICc and BIC. Default sort is BIC. print_results controls whether this is printed. In displaying these results, the pandas dataframe is designed to use the common greek letter parametrisations rather than the scale, shape, location, threshold parametrisations which can become confusing for some distributions.
-   a plot of the PDF and CDF of each fitted distribution along with a histogram of the failure data. The legend is not in any particular order.
-   a probability plot of each of the fitted distributions.
-   a semi-parametric probability-probability plot of parametric vs non-parametric distribution (a better fit is will lie on the red diagonal).
-   best_distribution - a distribution object created based on the parameters of the best fitting distribution. The best distribution is created as a distribution object that can be used like any of the other `distribution <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Creating%20and%20plotting%20distributions.html>`_ objects. See the examples below for how this can be used.
-   best_distribution_name - the name of the best fitting distribution. E.g. 'Weibull_3P'
-   parameters and goodness of fit tests for each fitted distribution. For example, the Weibull_3P distribution values are: Weibull_3P_alpha, Weibull_3P_beta, Weibull_3P_gamma, Weibull_3P_BIC, Weibull_3P_AICc.

Confidence intervals for each of the fitted parameters are not reported by ``Fitters.Fit_Everything`` as this would be a large number of outputs. If you need the confidence intervals for the fitted parameters you can repeat the fitting using just a specific distribution and the results will include the confidence intervals. Whilst Minitab uses the Anderson-Darling statistic for the goodness of fit, it is generally recognised that AICc and BIC are more accurate measures as they take into account the number of parameters in the distribution.

In this first example, we will use Fit_Everything on some data and will return only the dataframe of results. Note that we are actively supressing the 3 plots that would normally be shown to provide graphical goodness of fit indications.

In this second example, we will create some right censored data and use Fit_Everything. All outputs are shown, and the best fitting distribution is accessed and printed.

    The best fitting distribution was Weibull_2P which had parameters [11.27730642  3.30300716  0.        ]

The histogram is scaled based on the amount of censored data. If your censored data is all above or below your failure data then the histogram bars should line up well with the fitted distributions (assuming you have enough data). However, if your censored data is not always greater than the max of your failure data then the heights of the histogram bars will be scaled down and the plot may look incorrect. This is to be expected as the histogram is only a plot of the failure data and the totals will not add to 100% if there is censored data.

.. note:: The confidence intervals shown on the probability plots are only available for the Exponential (1P and 2P) and Weibull (2P and 3P) fitters. This library is in active development and over the next few months the confidence intervals will be added to the Normal and Lognormal Fitters followed by the Gamma and Beta Fitters.
