About the author
''''''''''''''''

The Python reliability library (``reliability``) was written by Matthew Reid. Matthew holds a Masters of Reliability Engineering from the University of Maryland, a Masters of Project Management from the University of New South Wales, and a Bachelor of Aeronautical Engineering from the University of New South Wales. Based in Melbourne, Australia, Matthew currently works as a reliability engineer on a variety of acquisition and sustainment projects for land materiel. ``reliability`` was written because there were no dedicated reliability engineering libraries for Python, and Matthew found himself needing to use scipy.stats, lifelines, Minitab, MATLAB, JMP Pro, and his own Python scripts, for a variety of common reliability engineering tasks that were not available in one place.

This is Matthew's first Python library on the Python Package Index and is a work in progress. In accordance with the `MIT license <https://github.com/MatthewReid854/reliability/blob/master/LICENCE>`_, every effort has been made to ensure the software is free of errors, however, no guarantees or warranties are provided in any form. Feedback on ``reliability`` is most welcome. If you find an error, have a suggestion, would like to request something to be included, or would like to contribute something, please send it through by email (m.reid854@gmail.com).
