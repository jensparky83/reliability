How to donate to the project
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Python reliability library is free, open source, and it always will be. It aims to provide students and professionals alike with a set of tools that you would otherwise only find in commercial software. Most commercial software is prohibitively expensive, especially for individuals, so I aim to bring these features to you for free by continuing to develop this library.

Developing and maintaining this library is all done in my free time and can be quite a time consuming process. If you would like to donate as a way of showing your appreciation, you can send whatever amount you feel is appropriate using `paypal.me <https://paypal.me/MatthewReid854?locale.x=en_AU>`_. If you don't want to say thanks with money that is fine too, as I always appreciate getting emails from people all over the world telling me that they find the library useful.
